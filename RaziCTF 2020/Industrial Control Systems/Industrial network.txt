Challenge:
In an industrial Modbus RTU network based on RS485 bus, the master wants to read a sensor data, the data packet has been sent to the slave is like below. 
Send the slave response to the master, also imagine the slave data is 40 (decimal). (data is in Hex format) 
Master req. = 06 03 00 00 00 01 85 BD The answer is not in the regular flag format.

Answer:
In order to solve this challenge, we just need to have a little knowledge about modbus protocol. 
There is also a great online tool available:

In RTU response mode:
First byte is the slave id,
next byte is the function id,
next byte is  the number of data bytes,
next bytes (depending on the previous two bytes value) are the actual data,
and last two bytes represent CRC.
Hence, the answer will be:
06 03 02 00 28 0D 9A
