Challenge:
There are 10 slaves in an industrial network, the master sends a request like below to control 5 outputs of a slave to high. Change the slave id to 4, 
change the sending packet to control just the first output to high, and the remaining to low and submit the new request. 
(protocol is Modbus RTU and data is in Hex format). Master req. = 09 0F 00 00 00 05 01 1F 2F 38 The answer is not in the regular flag format.

Answer:
In order to solve this challenge, we just need to have a little knowledge about modbus protocol. 
There is also a great online tool available:

In RTU request mode:
First byte is the slave id,
next byte is the function id,
next two bytes are the starting address,
next two bytes are the quantity,
next byte is the byte count,
next bytes (depending on the previous two bytes value) are the actual data (output value),
and last two bytes represent CRC.
Hence, the answer will be:
04 0F 00 00 00 05 01 01 6E A9
