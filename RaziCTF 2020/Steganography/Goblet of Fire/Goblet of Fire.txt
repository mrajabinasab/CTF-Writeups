Challenge:
I think Granger is smart enough to help you solve this challenge!

Answer:
This challenge has a very good hint!
First we open the txt file. At first it looks like a chapter of the Harry Potter story, but if we use CTRL+A, we can see that there are a lot of tabs and spaces.
So, it seems to be a whitespace stegano!
Best tool we now for whitespace Steganography is stegsnow. It needs a password and luckily the password is provided in the hint. Yes, Granger is very Smart! :D
