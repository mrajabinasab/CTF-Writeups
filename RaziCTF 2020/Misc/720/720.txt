Challenge:
These files belong to Lucius. I found them in his flash drive, but I could not open them. 
Can you figure out how to open them? Please avoid opening any unnecessary and dangerous files.

Answer:
In this challenge there are several files inside a zip file.
After extracting the zip file, printui.dll seems interesting. maybe it prints the flag, somehow. let's dig into that.
If we analyze this file using binwalk, we can see that there is a text file hidden in it.
we use binwalk inorder to extract that and it contains the flag.
easy, right?!
