Challenge:
You download the file, you stay in this challenge, and I show you how deep the file goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the flag. Nothing more.

Answer:
As the name suggests, this challenge is about a zipfile of a zipfile of a zipfile of a zipfile of a ...
At each step, the zipfile name is base64 and the password to extract it is the base64 decoded name.
so all we need is a simple python script to do that for us:
import os
import base64
from zipfile import ZipFile


i=1
while i==1:
	for f in os.listdir('.'):
		if f.endswith(".zip"):
			p = os.path.splitext(f)[0]
			passw2 = base64.b64decode(p)
			passw = passw2.decode('utf-8')
			with ZipFile(f) as zf:
				zf.extractall(pwd=bytes(passw))
			print(f)
            os.remove(f)

after extracting 10000 times (!), the challenge will be solved.
