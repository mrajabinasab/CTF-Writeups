Challenge:
This guy protected his music program with a serial number. Can you crack it?

Answer:
This challenge was very easy to solve.
All we have to do is to use strings command on the executable. It gives us some strings which look like serial numbers.
if we use 1337-1337-1337-1337, the flag will be printed by the program:
RaziCTF{your_fl4g_is_this_cute_flag}
