Challenge:
This guy protected his hello world program with a strange serial number. Can you crack it?

Answer:
There are many approaches for solving reverse engineering challenges, in this writeup we gonna use a fast and easy approach.
All we have to do is to open the executable with IDA-Pro and read the main function.
We can see that there are some characters getting PUSHed in this function. At first they seem random but if we take a closer look we can see that they are actually
meaningful. There are numbers representing alphabets and sometimes the words are scrambled, but still we can guess the flag (hoping the authors have a good english
understaning) :
