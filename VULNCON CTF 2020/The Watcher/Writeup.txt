I was actually trying to solve SUDOGF challenge and in the gpg keyfile, I found this email:
tjsince1337@gmail.com
sending an email to this address, hoping to find an answer to SUDOGF challenge, I recieved this email:

Hello Warrior!

I must say, You have worked hard to reach here. Well, I won't disappoint you xD
Here is your power spell,

If you haven't got the Real Owner of that photograph then you must get that first! He has a tag line though "Just jumped off runway 26L"

Cheers Mate!

As I already read The Watcher challenge, I knew that we needed to wrap the photographer's email
into vulncon{}, using the hint => "Just jumped off runway 26L" 
We can find out that the photographer is Agustin Anaya the email is: m.venema@dutchops.com
